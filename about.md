My name is **Girish Rao**, and this is my personal blog.  

I have 10 years of experience in Software Development and Automation. I am currently pursuing my masters in computer science at USC. I am passionate about solving complex engineering problems by utilizing my analytical and algorithm design skills. I am broadly interested in virtualization, cloud computing, algorithms, security and web development.

I am very comfortable in Java, Javascript and Python. I loved using swift, C, C++ for some of my academic projects.

I am a huge fan of iterative development methodologies like Agile. When the end goal is unclear, I start by establishing bounds and/or expected best / worst - case scenarios. By doing so, I get better clarity on the problem and its constraints. On a side note, I enjoy figuring out what existing code does, debugging issues and trying to break the software.

I
make
stuff.


*Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.*


I make what I love.

*I love what I do.*
