Well, I guess it's quite obvious that I really enjoy working with Jekyll — with good reasons — so let me just briefly suggest some of the benefits of using a static site generator in favor of a heavy dynamic, database driven content management system.

- **Speed**: Static HTML pages are small, lightweight and perform blazingly fast. You’ll notice the difference.

- **Version Control**: Contents and files remain on your computer. Perform backups or keep track of changes via GIT or SVN — *it’s quite easy without a database.*

- **Flexibility**: Ruby and Liquid — *Jekyll’s foundation* — empower you to easily extend its functionality. Or just use one of [many plugins](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/) created by a striving community.

- **Security**: Anything you’ll ever put on your server are static files — chances are good that *you’ll never need to worry* about security concerns anymore.

If that still doesn’t convince you to at least give it a try, I’d like to encourage you to head over to the Jekyll website and see it for yourself.

Enjoy!
