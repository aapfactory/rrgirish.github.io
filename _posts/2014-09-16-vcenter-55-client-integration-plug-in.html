<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><br />So it looks like the plugin doesn’t work on Chrome and IE11 browsers. Installing it multiple times continues to show that it is not installed. However, there is a workaround for Chrome which is as follows:<br /><ol><li>Download the plugin.</li><li>Close the browser.</li><li>Run the plugin installer as administrator. (Right click-&gt;Run as administrator)</li></ol>Now the client plugin works.</div>
