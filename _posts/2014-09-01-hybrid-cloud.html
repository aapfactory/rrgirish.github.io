<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Lets start by looking at what the definition of Hybrid Cloud is. This article from <a href="http://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/hybrid-cloud">searchcloudcomputing</a> certainly sums up most peoples view. <br /><i>A hybrid cloud is a composition of at least one private cloud and at least one public cloud. A hybrid cloud is typically offered in one of two ways: a vendor has a private cloud and forms a partnership with a public cloud provider, or a public cloud provider forms a partnership with a vendor that provides private cloud platforms.</i> <br />A good way of describing Hybrid cloud is explained <a href="http://www.thehostingnews.com/a-quick-guide-to-cloud-terminology.html">here</a> from hostingnews.com <br /><i>In some situations, the customer may need both a local server running specific applications and a cloud service that host’s additional applications, files, or databases. In such a situation, the two are often configured for interoperability.</i> <br />Ultimately a hybrid cloud is not made up of just two separate environments, with isolated from each other, the two environments have connectivity with each via the use of a VPN. <br />Another way of looking at Hybrid Cloud is providing a mechanism that sits above all the different technologies that can manage and deploy to these entities. A service broker is a nice term that has been used in the past. A consumer comes along, requests the deployment of the workload, and it is deployed on the best platform or technology suited to that workload, as shown in the diagram below. <br />&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-AFX5VV9hIas/VAVdyI9ycwI/AAAAAAAACX4/nHLZvkT267c/s1600-h/Hybrid-1%25255B6%25255D.jpg"><img alt="Hybrid-1" border="0" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-vtwVdDPoFBM/VAVd0-vCciI/AAAAAAAACYA/VfC8SsVk6Vc/Hybrid-1_thumb%25255B4%25255D.jpg?imgmax=800" height="199" style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Hybrid-1" width="389" /></a>  <br />So why are customers looking at deploying Hybrid Clouds and what are the key business drivers? <br />· Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)<i></i> <br />· Lower Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) when trying new markets<i></i> <br />· Business Agility<i></i> <br />· It provides a clear use case for public cloud computing<i></i> <br />· Using a hybrid cloud model is a valuable approach to architecture<i></i> <br />· Ability to mix and match resources between infrastructure availability<i></i> <br />· Solve resource constraint headaches by scaling out to the cloud<i></i> <br />· Innovation and new product development<i></i> <br />· Accelerating release cycles and speed to market <br /><blockquote>o Faster Application deployment<i></i></blockquote><blockquote>o Prolong legacy applications</blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
