>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;
><small><cite title="Plato">Plato</cite></small>

I have been away from the blogging scene for quite a while now. Today, it dawned upon me that I need to start writing again. My writing is a little bit rusty now.

The earlier blog was posted on Google Blogger. While it was satisfactory, I wanted more freedom with my themes and customize the pages the way I wanted.

Hence, I built this site using Jekyll, a blog aware static site generator. The blog posts can be easily edited with prose.io. I hope this site will perform as envisioned.
