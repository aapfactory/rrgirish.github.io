>&quot;The beginning is the most important part of the work.&quot;
><small><cite title="Plato">Plato</cite></small>

I have been away from the blogging scene for quite a while now, suddenly today it dawned upon me that I need to start writing/posting again. My writing is a little bit rusty now, and I need to brush on that. 

The earlier blog was posted on blogger. While it was satisfactory, I wanted more freedom with my themes and customize it more and more.

So I built this site using Jekyll, a blog aware static site generator. The blog posts can be easily edited with prose.io. I hope this site will perform as envisioned.
